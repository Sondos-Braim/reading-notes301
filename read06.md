# Node.js

-Node.js allows you to run your JavaScript code on your terminal.

-There are two ways in which node.js can be installed.

-It can be installed by visiting the website and downloading the node binaries needed for your system.

-Or you can use a version manager which is preferred because it will allow you to install multiple versions and switch between them when you need.

-It is very suitable for running JS code because it is built on V8 engine and it does not run using different browsers so you can have the latest version of the language running on your computer.

-`npm` comes with JS and it is responsible for installing packages that JS file will need to do different tasks.

-Sometimes you use npm to install packages globally which means that you will install them for your computer at large.

-Other times, you will install the package locally (only for a specific project).

-Node.js and npm can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

-Node.js is user-friendly and it can run the code on the server.

-Not developer prefers to work with node.js since they don’t like the fact that it runs in a single thread, and that it is event-driven.

-It is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.

-Node.js speaks JSON so you don’t have to switch format between the JS file, the server and the database.
