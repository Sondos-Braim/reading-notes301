## Javascript Templating

Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

Mustache is a specification for a templating language. In general, we would write templates according to the Mustache specification, and it can then be compiled by a templating engine to be rendered to create an output.


## Flex Box

There is an alternative way of creating layout for the page. IT is called flex box.

You can do it by giving the parent element `display:flex`.

And then giving the children `display:flex-box`.

You can change the order by the order property.

`order: 5; `.

You can change the direction with `flex-direction’.

A flexed item can be bigger by giving it more than one space. You can also shrink it.

If you don’t want all of the items to be on the same line you can use `flex-wrap`.
