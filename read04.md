## Regular Expressions

`Regular expressions` (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern.

## Grids
CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that elementâ€™s children (which become Grid Items).
